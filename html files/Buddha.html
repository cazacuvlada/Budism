                <b>Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism
                who later became known as “the Buddha,” lived during the 5th century B.C.
                Gautama was born into a wealthy family as a prince in present-day Nepal.
                Although he had an easy life, Gautama was moved by suffering in the world.
                He decided to give up his lavish lifestyle and endure poverty. When this didn’t fulfill him,
                he promoted the idea of the “Middle Way,” which means existing between two extremes.
                Thus, he sought a life without social indulgences but also without deprivation.
                After six years of searching, Buddhists believe Gautama found enlightenment while
                meditating under a Bodhi tree. He spent the rest of his life teaching others about
                how to achieve this spiritual state.

                    The Buddha taught his followers that the end of suffering, as described in the fourth Noble Truths,
                    could be achieved by following an Eightfold Path.
                    In no particular order, the Eightfold Path of Buddhism teaches the following ideals for
                    ethical conduct, mental disciple and achieving wisdom:

              Some four centuries after the Buddha’s death, movements arose in India, many of them centred on newly written
              texts (such as the Lotus Sutra) or new genres of texts (such as the Prajnaparamita or Perfection of Wisdom sutras)
              that purported to be the word of the Buddha. These movements would come to be designated by their adherents
              as the Mahayana, the “Great Vehicle” to enlightenment, in contradistinction to the earlier Buddhist schools
              One of the most important Mahayana sutras for a new conception of the Buddha is the Lotus Sutra
              (Saddharmapundarika-sutra), in which the Buddha denies that he left the royal palace in search of freedom
              from suffering and that he found that freedom six years later while meditating under a tree.that did not
              accept the new sutras as authoritative (that is, as the word of the Buddha). He explains instead that he
              achieved enlightenment innumerable billions of aeons ago and has been preaching the dharma in this world
              and simultaneously in myriad other worlds ever since. Because his life span is inconceivable to those
              of little intelligence, he has resorted to the use of skillful methods (upuya), pretending to renounce
              his princely life, practice austerities, and attain unsurpassed enlightenment. In fact, he was enlightened
              all the while yet feigned these deeds to inspire the world. Moreover, because he recognizes that his
              continued presence in the world might cause those of little virtue to become complacent about putting
              his teachings into practice, he declares that he is soon to pass into nirvana. But this also is not true,
              because his life span will not be exhausted for many more billions of aeons. He tells the story of a
              physician who returns home to find his children ill from having taken poison during his absence.
              He prescribes a cure, but only some take it. He therefore leaves home again and spreads the rumour
              that he has died. Those children who had not taken the antidote then do so out of deference to their
              departed father and are cured. The father then returns. In the same way, the Buddha pretends to enter
              nirvana to create a sense of urgency in his disciples even though his life span is limitless.
